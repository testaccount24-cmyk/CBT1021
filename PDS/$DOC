This file contains an improved version of EALSD095.

- Improved performance compared to IEFSD095 and EALSD095.
  - Requirement for work area eliminated, along with the GETMAIN
    and FREEMAIN to obtain and release the work area
  - Character lookup faster by eliminating the related loop.
- More special characters, including the Euro character.
- Some characters altered to match IEFSD095 or generally improve
  their appearance.
- Documentation improved.  It actually describes how it works!
- The euro character needs to be improved.  I am hopeful someone
  with better skills than me can do this.
- It uses the same calling sequence (except for the name of the
  module) as IEFSD095 and EALSD095).
- The object is arranged so that a program using IEFSD095 or
  EALSD095 can just removed the IEFSD095 or EALSD095 module
  and replace it with FANSD095.
- Believe it or not, it is actually smaller than EALSD095!
